The advent of the web brought infinite possibilities. It changed the way we learn, work and socialize because we were no longer limited by borders; real or imagined. However there was a problem: Lack of standard guidelines and proper structure. Due to the divergence of individual initiatives the [Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/) was created.

## Introduction

WAI is one of the initiatives created by the [World Wide Web Consortium(W3C)](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/) as an effort to improve accessibility on the web.

According to Tim Bernes-Lee, Director of the W3C and inventor of the World Wide Web:

<blockquote>
	<p>Worldwide, there are more than 750 million people with disabilities. As we move towards a highly connected world, it is critical that the web be usable by anyone, regardless of individual capabilities and disabilities.</p>
</blockquote>

WAI pursues accessibility through the following ways:

- Ensuring that web technologies support accessibility.
- Developing guidelines for web content, applications, browsers, and authoring tools.
- Developing tools to evaluate and facilitate accessibility.
- Supporting education and outreach on web accessibility.
- Co-ordinating with research and development that may impact the future of accessibility on the web.
- Promoting harmonized international uptake of web accessibility standards.

## Organization

WAI consists of several [working groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_group) and [special interest groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Interest_Group). Each working together for a common goal: improve accessibility on the web. The following are the working and special interest groups :

- [Accessibility Guideline Working Group (formerly the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/).
- [Accessible Platform Architectures (APA) Working Group](https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/).
- [Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) Working Group](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/).
- [Education and Outreach Working Group (EOWG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/about/groups/eowg/).
- [WAI Interest Group (WAI IG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/about/groups/waiig/).

## Summary

WAI was created by the [W3C](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/) as an effort to improve accessibility on the web. They develop accessibility standards and offer implementation guidance. WAI is made up of several working groups and special interest groups working together for a common goal: improve accessibility.
